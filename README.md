> **Keys never leave the browser in the clear.** Wallets are generated client-side and encrypted
> with authenticated **AES-256-GCM** *before* anything is sent — the server only ever stores public
> keys, ciphertext, and an ed25519 auth public key (never a private key, the encryption key, or a
> passkey-derived secret). Storage runs on local **Redis** in dev and **Upstash / Vercel KV** in
> production. Extracted from the `next-ttc` trading platform so any project can drop in the same auth.

## ✨ Why

- **Three login methods** behind one client.
- **Wallets are generated in the browser** and encrypted (authenticated AES-256-GCM) under a key
  derived from your passkey/signature **before** anything reaches the server. The server only ever
  stores public keys, ciphertext, and an ed25519 **auth public key** — never a private key, never the
  encryption key, and never a passkey-derived secret.
- **Deterministic recovery:** the same passkey+email (or the same wallet signature) re-derives
  the encryption key on any device, so wallets decrypt anywhere with zero server-side key storage.

## 📦 Install

```bash
npm i @tetrac/login-sdk
# peers (supply what you use):
npm i @solana/web3.js viem tweetnacl
# storage backend (pick one):
npm i ioredis            # dev (localhost)

```

## 🧩 Subpath exports

| Import | Use in | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `@tetrac/login-sdk/core` | anywhere | types, config, key derivation, AES, CSPRNG |
| `@tetrac/login-sdk/client` | browser | wallet generation, sessions, WebAuthn, `AuthClient` |
| `@tetrac/login-sdk/server` | backend | challenge/signature/session verify, route factory |
| `@tetrac/login-sdk/storage` | backend | `StorageAdapter` + Redis/Vercel KV/Upstash/Memory |
| `@tetrac/login-sdk/react` | browser | `AuthProvider`, `useAuth`, `useUser`, `useWallets`, `useActiveWallet`, `useSigner`, `useSolanaSigner`, `useEvmSigner`, `useExportKey` |
| `@tetrac/login-sdk/ui` | browser (optional) | `LoginPanel`, `ExportKeyPanel` |
| `@tetrac/login-sdk/next` | Next App Router | `createNextAuthRoutes` |
| `@tetrac/login-sdk/ledger` | browser (optional) | `useSolanaLedger` (native WebUSB/WebHID), `createLedgerSolanaSigner`, `encodeOffchainMessage` |

## 🖥️ Server (Next.js App Router)

```ts
// app/api/auth/[...action]/route.ts
import { createNextAuthRoutes } from "@tetrac/login-sdk/next";
import { resolveStorageAdapter } from "@tetrac/login-sdk/storage";

const storage = await resolveStorageAdapter(); // Redis dev / KV / Upstash by env
export const { GET, POST } = createNextAuthRoutes({ storage });
```

Endpoints served (all under the mount point, e.g. `/api/auth/challenge`):
`POST challenge | register | login | login-wallet | connect-wallet | import-wallet | logout`,
`GET user-data | search-wallet`. `import-wallet`, `logout`, and `user-data` require the session
headers (`ttc-auth-token` + `ttc-public-key`); the rest are public, though several still require a
single-use challenge + signature **in the request body**. Unknown actions return `404`; only `GET`/`POST`
are served.

## ⚛️ Client (React)

```tsx
import { AuthProvider, useAuth } from "@tetrac/login-sdk/react";

function Root() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider apiBaseUrl="/api/auth">
      <LoginButtons />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}

function LoginButtons() {
  const { status, registerWithEmail, loginWithWallet, registerWithBiometric } = useAuth();

  // 1) Email + passkey — generates & encrypts wallets client-side
  const email = () => registerWithEmail({ email: "a@b.com", passkey: "••••••" });

  // 2) Web3 wallet (e.g. Phantom via wallet-adapter)
  const wallet = (adapter) =>
    loginWithWallet({ publicKey: adapter.publicKey.toBase58(), signMessage: adapter.signMessage });

  // 3) Biometric (Touch ID / Face ID, WebAuthn PRF)
  const bio = () => registerWithBiometric({ userName: "a@b.com" });

  return <>status: {status}</>;
}
```

### Generating wallets directly

```ts
import { generateWalletBundle, flattenBundle, toSolanaKeypair } from "@tetrac/login-sdk/client";

const bundle = generateWalletBundle({
  appKey,                       // derived from passkey+email or wallet signature
  solana: ["funds", "signing"], // funds = holds assets; signing = agent wallet
  evm:    ["funds", "signing"],
});

bundle.solana.funds.publicKey;       // base58
bundle.evm.signing.publicKey;        // 0x… (EVM address)
flattenBundle(bundle);               // public keys + ciphertext only -> safe to send

// decrypt-to-sign (key released right after the callback)
const kp = toSolanaKeypair(bundle.solana.funds, appKey);
```

### Optional biometric unlock (any account)

Any account — **email, Web3, or biometric-primary** — can opt into unlocking the vault (and
revealing/​signing) with a device biometric (Touch ID / Face ID) instead of re-entering a passkey
or re-signing a wallet message. The biometric secret does **not** replace the app key (that only
works for biometric-primary accounts); it **wraps** the account's existing app key with
HKDF-SHA-256 + AES-256-GCM. Enable requires an unlocked vault; unlock always needs a fresh
assertion, so a storage-scraping XSS reads ciphertext it can never open. It is per-device and
**never** the recovery path — the account's primary credential stays the cross-device fallback.

```tsx
import { useBiometricUnlock } from "@tetrac/login-sdk/react";

function BiometricToggle() {
  const { available, isEnabled, enable, disable, unlock, loading } = useBiometricUnlock();
  if (!available) return null;
  return isEnabled
    ? <button disabled={loading} onClick={() => disable()}>Disable biometric unlock</button>
    : <button disabled={loading} onClick={() => enable("a@b.com")}>Enable biometric unlock</button>;
  // After an auto-lock, call unlock() to re-arm the vault via Touch ID.
}
```

Once enabled, reveal/​unlock anywhere `ReauthCredentials` is accepted via the new
`{ biometricUnlock: registration }` variant (e.g. `reveal({ biometricUnlock: reg })`). Do **not**
confuse it with `{ registration }`, which is the biometric-**primary** flow where the secret *is*
the app key — the two resolve to different keys and are not interchangeable. The same functions are
available standalone from `@tetrac/login-sdk/client`
(`enableBiometricUnlock` / `unlockViaBiometric` / `disableBiometricUnlock` / `hasBiometricUnlock`)
and as `AuthClient` methods. Full design: [`features/unlockViaBiometric.md`](./features/unlockViaBiometric.md).

## ⛓️ Chain scope: Solana vs EVM

Both chains can have wallets generated and stored, but only one is an **authentication identity** — by design:

| Capability | Solana | EVM |
|---|---|---|
| External-wallet **login / registration** (prove ownership of a connected wallet) | ✅ ed25519 signature over the challenge | ❌ by design |
| Wallet **generated client-side & encrypted** under the app key | ✅ | ✅ |
| Stored server-side as **public key + ciphertext** | ✅ | ✅ |
| Used for **internal signing** | ✅ `useSolanaSigner` | ✅ `useEvmSigner` (viem `LocalAccount`) |
| Server **signature verification** | ✅ `verifySolanaSignature` | ❌ none (intentional) |

External-wallet auth (`authMethod: "wallet"`) is gated **solely** on `verifySolanaSignature`; submitting an
EVM address as a wallet identity returns `401`. There is intentionally **no `verifyEvmSignature`** — EVM
keypairs are *internally* generated (viem) and encrypted exactly like Solana wallets, used for **signing
only**, never as a login credential. The security boundary: **Solana = Web3 login identity; EVM (and any
other generated keypair) = internal signing wallet only.**

## ⚙️ Configuration

Override any subset via the `config` option on the route factory / `AuthClient`; unspecified fields
fall back to `DEFAULT_CONFIG` (nested groups merge shallowly). Defaults shown:

```ts
{
  appId: "ttc",                     // OVERRIDE IN PROD: unique + stable per deployment; domain-separates
                                    // every app key (PBKDF2 salt + wallet sign-message). Default = no
                                    // cross-app isolation (warns); changing it later re-derives all keys.
  securityLevel: 2,                 // PBKDF2 iters for email/passkey: 1=100k, 2=600k (default), 3=1M;
                                    // the resolved count is pinned per-user at registration.
  challengeTtlSeconds: 300,
  sessionHeader: "ttc-auth-token",
  publicKeyHeader: "ttc-public-key",
  sessionTtlSeconds: 14_400,        // session tokens expire server-side after 4h
  trustProxyHeaders: false,         // see "Production deployment notes" below
  trustedProxyHops: 0,              // when trustProxyHeaders: take the rightmost XFF entry after N trusted hops
  keyPrefixes: { challenge: "challenge:", pubKey: "pubKey:", session: "session:", email: "email:", rateLimit: "ratelimit:" },
  rateLimit: { windowSeconds: 60, maxAttempts: 10 },
  webauthn: { rpName: "TTC", preferPrf: true },
  autoLockMs: 15_000,               // in-browser app key auto-locks after 15s idle
  lockOnHide: true,                 // lock the vault when the tab is hidden / frozen
  revealRequiresReauth: true,       // plaintext reveal always re-runs the ceremony
  maxWalletsPerUser: 64,            // import-wallet total cap (record-bloat guard)
}
```

> The in-browser app/encryption key is **memory-only** — there is no `sessionStorage`/`localStorage`
> option to configure. `appId` **must** be set to a unique, stable value per deployment in production;
> the default `"ttc"` gives no cross-app key isolation.

### Production deployment notes

- **Behind a trusted proxy (Vercel, Cloudflare, nginx)?** Set
  `trustProxyHeaders: true` so per-IP rate limiting uses `x-forwarded-for`.
  With the default `false`, proxy headers are ignored (they're client-spoofable
  when there's no proxy) and all traffic shares one IP bucket — safe, but it
  effectively turns the per-IP limit into a global one.
- **Sessions expire.** Tokens die server-side after `sessionTtlSeconds` (4h
  default) and each new login revokes the previous token. `logout()` revokes
  the current token best-effort via `POST /logout` (with `keepalive` so it lands
  during unload) before clearing local state; clearing the shared token also locks
  sibling tabs of the same origin.

### Environment

```
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379        # dev
# prod (pick one):
VERCEL=1                                 # @vercel/kv

- Private keys: encrypted at rest with **authenticated AES-256-GCM** (Web Crypto) — a wrong key or any
  tampering throws on decrypt; never stored or transmitted in plaintext.
- Key derivation + hashing use **`@noble/hashes`** (no `crypto-es`): email/passkey app keys are
  **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** with iterations from `securityLevel` (1=100k, 2=600k default, 3=1M), pinned
  per-user; Web3 app keys are `SHA-256` over a fixed wallet message.
- **`appId` domain separation:** `appId` is mixed into both derivations (the PBKDF2 salt
  `SHA-256(appId:email)` and the wallet sign-message), so the same user/wallet derives a *different*
  app key per deployment — a key cracked or coerced on one app can't unlock the same user on another.
- App/encryption key: **memory-only** — never `sessionStorage`, never `localStorage`, never sent to the
  server. A tab reload (or crash) drops it, so the user must re-authenticate to decrypt wallets and
  storage-scraping XSS finds no key at rest. Auto-locks after `autoLockMs` idle and on tab hide / page
  freeze / bfcache restore; locked signers throw `VaultLockedError` until re-auth. To survive a reload
  without re-running a passkey ceremony, use **biometric unlock** (a Touch/Face-ID-gated wrapped blob).
- Revealing a plaintext key always re-runs the auth ceremony (passkey / wallet signature /
  Face ID) — never the ambient session key.
- **Authentication is by signature — no server-stored passkey hash.** Every account signs a single-use
  32-byte challenge (5-min TTL, atomic consume). Email/biometric accounts sign with an ed25519 keypair
  derived from the app key; the server stores **only** the public key (`authPublicKey`) and verifies the
  signature. Web3 logins verify a Solana signature with `tweetnacl`.
- Biometric: WebAuthn `userVerification: required`; PRF preferred; gate fallback wraps its secret
  under a non-extractable AES-GCM key in IndexedDB.
- Optional biometric unlock (any account): the current app key is wrapped with HKDF-SHA-256 +
  authenticated AES-256-GCM under a passkey secret and stored per-device; unwrapping always needs a
  fresh biometric assertion. Purged on `disableBiometricUnlock` and on logout (`clearSession`).
  See [`features/unlockViaBiometric.md`](./features/unlockViaBiometric.md).
- Sessions: opaque 256-bit bearer tokens, **single active session** (each login revokes the prior token),
  server-side TTL (**4h default**). `logout()` revokes via `POST /logout` with `keepalive` so it lands
  during page unload. Optional `bindSessionToUserAgent` (default off) pins a session to `SHA-256(User-Agent)`
  as defense-in-depth against stolen-token reuse — note a UA change (browser update) then forces re-login.
- Rate limiting is **per-target** (e.g. `login:<email>`, `challenge:<id>`) plus a per-IP bucket when
  behind a trusted proxy (`trustProxyHeaders` / `trustedProxyHops`), so a flood on one target can't lock
  out everyone. Responses never echo credential secrets.

## 🧪 Develop

```bash
npm run build         # tsup -> ESM + CJS + d.ts
npm test              # jest
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm run format        # prettier --write . (code only; Markdown is .prettierignore'd)
npm run format:check  # prettier --check . (CI gate)
```

Formatting is enforced in CI via `format:check`. Run `npm run format` before committing — an editor
"format on save" with the Prettier extension (it picks up [`.prettierrc.json`](./.prettierrc.json)) keeps
you green automatically.

## 🤝 Contributing

Every change — feature or bug fix — lands the same way: **write it down, prove it with a
test, then make it pass.** The vault-singleton fix is the reference example end-to-end:
PRD [`features/sdk-vault-singleton.md`](./features/sdk-vault-singleton.md) → test
[`tests/dual-bundle-vault.test.ts`](./tests/dual-bundle-vault.test.ts) → fix in
`src/client/session.ts`.

### 1. Write a PRD in `features/`

Add `features/<short-name>.md` **before** you write code:

- **Bug** — what breaks, the root cause, and how to reproduce. If there's more than one way
  to fix it, list the options and mark the one you picked (and why), as the vault-singleton
  PRD does.
- **Feature** — the behaviour, the public API / subpath exports it touches, and the
  security implications. This is an auth SDK: explicitly call out anything that touches
  **keys, sessions, signatures, or storage**.

Keep it short, and link it from the README where a reader would look for it (see how
[`features/unlockViaBiometric.md`](./features/unlockViaBiometric.md) is referenced above).

### 2. Add a test that proves it — `tests/<short-name>.test.ts`

The filename **must end in `.test.ts`** — jest only collects `tests/**/*.test.ts`, so a
plain `tests/my-feature.ts` is silently ignored.

- **Bug** → write a *characterization* test that demonstrates the defect, not just the
  current behaviour. It either fails on `main`, or (like `dual-bundle-vault.test.ts`) passes
  while documenting the bug and then flips to assert the fixed invariant — that test's header
  spells out the lifecycle.
- **Feature** → specify the expected behaviour up front; it should be red until you implement.
- Reuse the shared fixtures in [`tests/_auth-helpers.ts`](./tests/_auth-helpers.ts) and match
  a nearby test's style.
- **Testing a build / bundling artifact?** Inspect the built `dist/` (as
  `dual-bundle-vault.test.ts` does) and run `npm run build` first — a source-level import
  resolves to a single module instance and hides bundling bugs.

### 3. Implement until the full gate is green

Run the gate from **Develop** above — **all of it must pass, not just your test:**

```bash
npm run format:check && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build
```

Don't weaken or delete an existing test to go green. If a test's intent legitimately changed
(e.g. a documented bug is now fixed), rewrite it to assert the new invariant and explain why
in the diff — see how `dual-bundle-vault.test.ts` flipped from proving the bug to guarding the
singleton.

### 4. Open a Pull Request

- Branch from `main` (`fix/<name>` or `feat/<name>`).
- In the description: link the `features/` PRD, summarise the change, and confirm
  `build` + `typecheck` + `test` are green.
- Keep the dependency boundaries intact — `dependencies` / `peerDependencies` /
  `devDependencies` and the `external` list in [`tsup.config.ts`](./tsup.config.ts) are
  classified deliberately so consumers supply a single copy of each peer; don't bundle a peer
  or add a runtime dep without saying why in the PRD.
- Leave `version` in `package.json` alone unless the change is a release (bump it in its own
  step, not in every PR).
